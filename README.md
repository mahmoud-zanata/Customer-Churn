# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on building a model to predict customer churn based on historical data. The aim is to help businesses identify customers who are likely to leave and take preemptive actions to retain them.

## Project Overview

The **Customer Churn Prediction** project includes the following steps:
1. **Data Understanding**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming and creating features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Training multiple machine learning models to predict churn.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models' performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution and documentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains customer information and their status (churned or not churned). Key features include:
- Customer demographics
- Account information
- Service usage

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-zanata/Customer-Churn.git
   cd Customer-Churn
Results
The best-performing model achieved [90.7%] on the test set. This model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn.

Future Work
Integrating additional features to improve accuracy.
Deploying the model into a production environment using Flask or FastAPI.
Providing actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
